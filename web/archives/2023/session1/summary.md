### Session 1: Introduction to Data Reproducibility

#### Instructor: Juliana Simas

In this session we will discuss the reproducibility crisis in science, as well as principles and tools that help make research more reproducible. In addition, we will go over how to maintain a computational lab notebook, including the basics of an online markdown-based tool [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/), [GitHub](https://github.com) and Git for version control. We will also briefly introduce [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org), a scientific workflow tool that requires few programming skills to perform bioinformatics analyses.
